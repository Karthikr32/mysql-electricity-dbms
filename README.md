# Electricity Billing & Usage Analysis â€“ MySQL Project
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This project demonstrates practical SQL skills by analyzing electricity usage data across multiple households using MySQL. 
It includes a set of real-world SQL tasks, stored procedures, triggers, and joins, all executed using MySQL Workbench. 
The project also includes a PowerPoint presentation with output screenshots and detailed task explanations.

## Used Tables
- Household_info
- Appliance_usage
- Billing_info
- Calculated_metrics
- Environmental_details  

These are the data set given to us. Which has to be imported first into workbench then using SQL we process the data set to generate reports on different perspective.
